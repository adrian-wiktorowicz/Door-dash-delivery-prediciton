# Delivery Time Prediction Based on DoorDash Data

This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate food delivery times based on real-world DoorDash data.

## Project Overview

- The goal was to develop an accurate regression model that predicts the delivery time for orders.
- The dataset included information such as order details, distances, travel times, weather conditions, and route types.
- The project involved:
  - Data analysis and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Testing multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest)
  - Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results

- XGBoost outperformed traditional regression methods, achieving the best performance.
- The final model reached a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of approximately **5.7 minutes**, demonstrating strong predictive capability.
